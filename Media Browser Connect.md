Media Browser Connect makes it easy to sign into your apps when away from home, and manage connections to multiple servers.

### How it Works

Normally signing into a server requires three pieces of information - the server ip address, along with a username and password. With Media Browser Connect you no longer need to know a server's ip address in order to connect.

## Guide for Administrators

If you're the administrator of a Media Browser server, the Connect feature makes it easier than ever to invite your family and friends to share your media.

### Sending an Invitation

Inviting a friend is easy. Open the server dashboard and navigate to **Users**. Then in the **Guests** section, click the + button to invite a new guest.

For a detailed guide on inviting a guest, see [Guests](Guests).
