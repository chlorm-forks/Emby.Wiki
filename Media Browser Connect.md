Media Browser Connect makes it easy to sign into your apps when away from home, and manage connections to multiple servers.

## How it Works

Normally signing into a server requires three pieces of information - the server ip address, along with a username and password. With Media Browser Connect you no longer need to know a server's ip address in order to connect.
