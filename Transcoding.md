## Audio Boost

When surround audio is converted to 2-channel stereo audio, this often results in a lower volume level. To offset this, you can configure an audio boost scale factor to increase the volume.

The default value is **2**, meaning the volume will be doubled when converting surround audio to stereo.


## Debug Logging

Debug logging can be enabled as needed for troubleshooting.

**Note**: Debug logging will significantly increase the size of transcoding log files, and therefore is only recommended as needed to resolve issues.
