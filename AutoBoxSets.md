Automatically create collections for your movies. You no longer have to make special folders or maintain your own collections. This plug-in will keep all your movies organized into collections for you, based on the same **TmdbCollectionId** data from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/). 

To install the plugin, click **Plugins** in the side-bar menu of the Emby server dashboard, and select the **Catalogue** tab.

Scroll down to the **General** section of the page, and click on the plugin image.

When the server has restarted, click **Plugins** in the side-bar menu of the Emby server dashboard, and select the **My Plugins** tab.

You will see the **AutoBoxSets** plugin listed (along with any other plugins already installed), where you can open the settings page, by clicking on the 3-dot menu.
