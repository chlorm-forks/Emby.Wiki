Emby Live TV supports Silicon Dust HDHomerun Network Tuners.

In most cases, Emby Server will automatically discover your HDHomerun on your network with no configuration required. If this does not happen for you, adding a tuner manually is very simple. Simply open the server dashboard, navigate to Live TV, then click Add underneath tuner devices.

On the HD Homerun setup screen, you'll need to enter the IP Address of your HDHomerun Network Tuner.

There are also additional options, such as the ability to allow hardware video transcoding by the tuner, if it supports that. In most cases, trusting the default settings will be the best option.
