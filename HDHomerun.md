Emby has native support for Silicon Dust HDHomeRun Network Tuners. Unlike other brands of tuners, HDHomeRun tuners run as standalone devices connected to your network. No need to have open PCI slots available in your server or free USB ports.  Being a standalone device allows you to install these in close proximity to your OTA antenna or cable drop.  As long as you can connect the device to your home Ethernet network you can install them anywhere in your home. Silicon Dust makes both OTA (Over the Air) models as well as Cable Tuners (using a cable card) to Receive DRM free digital cable subscription channels.

In most cases, Emby can automatically discover your HDHomerun devices on your network with no configuration required. You can also manually setup a tuner as well. Simply open the server dashboard, navigate to Live TV, then click Add underneath tuner devices.

On the HD Homerun setup screen, you'll need to enter the IP Address of your HDHomerun Network Tuner.

There are also additional options, such as the ability to allow hardware video transcoding by the tuner, if it supports that. In most cases, trusting the default settings will be the best option.
