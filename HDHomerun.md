Emby Live TV supports Silicon Dust HDHomerun Network Tuners.

In most cases, Emby Server will automatically discover your HDHomerun on your network with no configuration required. If this does not happen for you, adding a tuner manually is very simple. Simply open the server dashboard, navigate to Live TV, then click Add underneath tuner devices.
