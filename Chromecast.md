Emby supports casting to Chromecast in the following apps:

* Android Mobile
* iOS
* Web Client (Chrome only)

To connect to your Chromecast device, simply click the cast icon in the top right corner of the app. You'll then be asked which device you'd like to connect to.

Emby for Chromecast can handle just about any type of media thanks to [Emby Server transcoding](Transcoding). If you would like to learn how to prepare your media for Direct Play, read below.

# Direct Play Media Formats

* Video — MP4, M4V, MKV, WEBM
* Subtitles - SRT and other text-based formats
* Audio – AAC, MP3, WAV

# Best Practices for Direct Play

* Ensure your media meets the above criteria.

* Compare the bitrate of your files to the Chromecast bitrate setting in the app. You can find the bitrate of a file by checking the media info in the web interface. If the bitrate of a file is higher than the setting in the app, transcoding will be required. Increasing the bitrate setting in the app can help reduce transcoding, but may impact playback performance if your network connection is not fast enough to handle it.
