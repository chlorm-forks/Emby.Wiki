Folder sync allows you to copy content to folders and external hard drives, for backup as well as archiving in multiple resolutions.

When content is archived in multiple resolutions, Emby apps will automatically choose the version that is most efficient for them. This will help relieve stress on your server's CPU.

## Installation

To install folder sync, open the **Emby Server Dashboard** and navigate to **Sync** -> **Services**. 

Click on Google Drive underneath **Available Services**.
