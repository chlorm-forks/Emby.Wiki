This purpose of this document is to discuss how to connect to Emby Server from additional devices, both within your home network and external. To learn how to grant users access to your server, see [Users](Users).

In most cases you won't need to do anything to connect to your server from other devices, as Emby apps are built to automatically know how to connect to it. But on some systems some manual configuration might be necessary. This document is primarily designed as for troubleshooting when the automatic features do not work.

# Internal Connections

Emby apps can automatically discover your Emby Server on your home network, so in most cases, there's nothing more you need to do. But in the event this does not work, you can still connect to your Emby Server by manually entering the server's address.

To locate your server's internal address, simply open the Emby Server Dashboard on the Emby Server machine, typically http://localhost:8096
