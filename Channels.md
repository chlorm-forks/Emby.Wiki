Channels are plugins that provide access to streaming internet audio and video.

For more information on plugins, as well as how to install and configure them, see [Plugins](Plugins).

## Channel Settings

To configure the settings for an individual channel, simply click on it within [My Plugins](Plugins#my-plugins). 

## Global Channel Settings

There are also settings that can be configured globally for all channels. These are found in the server dashboard by navigating to **Plugins** -> **Channels**.

### Channel Quality

For bandwidth-constrained environments, limiting the channel quality can help ensure a smooth streaming experience.

Please note this setting is only a preference and not a guarantee. Not all channels support multiple-resolutions, and in such cases you'll be limited to what's available.

In addition you can also configure channel content downloading. This allows you to download content ahead of time before viewing, in which case it will be streamed directly from your server instead of the internet. Please note that not all channels support this, and some limit the amount of downloading per day.
