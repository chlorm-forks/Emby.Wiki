Channels are plugins that provide access to streaming internet audio and video.

For more information on plugins, as well as how to install and configure them, see [Plugins](Plugins).

## Channel Settings

To configure the settings for an individual channel, simply click on it within [My Plugins](Plugins#my-plugins). 

## Global Channel Settings

There are also settings that can be configured globally for all channels. These are found in the server dashboard by navigating to **Plugins** -> **Channels**.

For bandwidth-constrained environments, limiting the channel quality can help ensure a smooth streaming experience.

Please note this setting is only a preference and not a guarantee. Not all channels support multiple-resolutions, and in such cases you'll be limited to what's available.

In addition you can also configure channel content downloading.
