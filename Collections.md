Collections are personalized groupings of library content. Collections are generally used to group movies together but can also be used for TV Series and other library content.

## How to Create a Collection

To create a collection, start with a Movie, Series, or any other item in your Emby library. Open the context menu for that item using one of the following methods:

* Right click on the poster
* Use the 3-Dot menu on the detail screen
* Mouse over the poster and use the 3-Dot menu

When the context menu appears, select "Add to Collection". You'll then be presented with a popup where you can add the item to an existing collection, or create a new one.

When creating a new collection, you can also enable searching the internet for artwork related to that collection. TheMovieDb.Org has artwork for Movie Collections, and if you give your collections the same name, then Emby server can automatically download Collection artwork.

An example name of a Collection is "Star Wars Collection".
