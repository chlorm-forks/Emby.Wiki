## Running the Startup Wizard

After Emby Server has been installed, it will attempt to launch the startup wizard in your default browser. If this does not occur automatically, please open your web browser and navigate to:

[http://localhost:8096/web/wizardstart.html](http://localhost:8096/web/wizardstart.html)

### Language Selection

The first page will ask you to choose a display language. We have been working hard to translate Emby into as many languages as possible, and the available options are displayed on this page.

### Create a User

Next you'll be asked to create an initial user account. You'll have the ability to create more accounts later after the setup process has completed. 

As an option, you also have the ability to link the account to [Emby Connect](Emby Connect). Emby Connect makes it easy to connect to your Emby Server while you're away from home. This is purely an optional step and can be skipped if desired. You can always do this later after completing the startup wizard by visiting the [Users](Users) section of the server's web interface.

### Configure Settings

On the third page you'll configure your default metadata settings, such as where they'll get saved and in what language.
