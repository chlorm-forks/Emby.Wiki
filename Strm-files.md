Various internet video and audio streams can be played back in Media Browser as if they were locally stored on your media center by using STRM files. As long as the format and streaming-method (network-protocol) is supported by Media Browser, stream can be added. These are basic text files that look like <name>.strm and contain a URL to the internet stream
 
### Usage

Create a normal text-file and rename the .txt extension to .strm then open it up with a text-editor (like Notepad in Microsoft Windows) and input the the direct URL-link of the stream.

This should look like:

```
http://host/path/stream
```

or 

```
mms://host/path/stream
```

or 

```
rtsp://host/path/stream
```
