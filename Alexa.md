### What is Alexa?  
Amazon Alexa is a cloud-based voice service, so it is always getting smarter. Ask Alexa to play music, hear the news, check weather, control your smart home, and more.
 
The Emby Skill enables users to get information about and control playback of their media library on any Emby compatible device. Once you have succesfully linked your Emby account to Alexa, you can start playing your favorite movies, TV shows on your devices with your voice.

## Get started  
The first step is to add [Emby with Alexa](Alexa#emby-with-amazon-alexa) to your Amazon account. Once this is done, you will need [Emby Connect](Emby%20Connect) to link your Emby account to Alexa. Emby with Alexa also requires Emby premiere.

In the Amazon Alexa app or the [Amazon Alexa web app](http://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html), navigate to the following:

`Skills > Your Skills > Emby > Link Account`

## Training Alexa
Alexa may have difficulty understanding the word Emby at first. There are ways to improve this situation.
#### English US only
If Alexa is set to English US, you have access to voice training. Using this, Alexa will start understanding you instead of guessing what you said. In the Amazon Alexa app or the [Amazon Alexa web app](http://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html), navigate to the following:

`Settings > Under Accounts > Voice training`

#### Every languages
The Amazon Alexa app offers feedback cards for skills. This allows Alexa to self-correct, by marking these cards positively or negatively depending on if Alexa understood you or not. In the Amazon Alexa app or the [Amazon Alexa web app](http://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html), navigate to the either:

`Home > Cards regarding Emby > More > Did Alexa understand you?`  
`Settings > Under General > History > Did Alexa do what you wanted?`

## Commands
### Understanding Alexa
* Every command will need to start with Alexa, tell/ask Emby to {insert command} OR you can start an Emby session: Alexa, start/begin/open Emby. The benefit of using an Emby session is Alexa knows anything you say will be directed to Emby. This improves the listening session.

### Navigation
You can navigate your interface by saying the movement or action related to what you want to do.
