The offline downloading feature allows you to copy your content to mobile devices for offline viewing. Download jobs are created using either the server's web interface or an Emby app on a mobile device. The server will then convert the media for the device as necessary. The apps will then sync the content by running a periodic background sync process.

The apps that currently support syncing are:

* [Android Mobile](Android Mobile)
* [Emby for Windows Store](Emby Theater for Windows)
* Ember for Emby (third party app)

The feature is coming soon to:
