Apps that support [Sync](Sync) also allow you to sign in when offline. The sign in process will be much the same as the normal sign in, and will allow you to access all content that has been synced to that point.

## Offline Pin Code

A pin can be assigned by server administrators by opening the server **dashboard** and navigating to **Users**. Then click on a User and navigate to the Passwords tab.
