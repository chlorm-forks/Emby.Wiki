The offline downloading feature allows you to copy your content to mobile devices for offline viewing. Download jobs are created using either the server's web interface or an Emby app on a mobile device. The server will then convert the media for the device as necessary. The apps will then download the content by running a periodic background sync process.

The Emby apps that currently support offline downloading are:

* [Emby for Android Mobile](Android Mobile)
* [Emby for Windows Store](Emby Theater for Windows)

The feature is coming soon to:

* [Emby for iOS](iOS)

The feature is also available in the following third party apps:

* Ember for Emby (third party app)

# How it Works

Apps that support offline downloading will display "Make Available Offline" options on media detail screens.
