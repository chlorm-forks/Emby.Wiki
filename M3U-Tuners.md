Emby Live TV supports setting up M3U files as TV Tuners. Each M3U file will contain a list of channels, along with information such as channel name, id, and how to play the channel.

See examples of m3u files at http://xmtvplayer.com/build-m3u-file

To add an M3U tuner, simply open the Emby Server dashboard, navigate to Live TV, then click Add underneath tuner devices.
