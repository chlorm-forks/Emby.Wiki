There are two ways to identify a video as 3D.

## Using the web interface

## Video filenames flags

## Brackets

Older file naming conventions are still accepted  by placing one of the following tags within the filename:

* [fsbs] - Indicates full side by side
* [ftab] - Indicates full top and bottom
* [hsbs] - Indicates half side by side
* [htab] - Indicates half top and bottom
* [3d] - Indicates half side by side
* [sbs3d] - Indicates half side by side

For example:

```
/Movies
   /300
     300 [hsbs].mkv
   /Home Alone (1990)
     Home Alone [fsbs].mkv
```
