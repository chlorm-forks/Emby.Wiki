Plugins extend the functionality of Media Browser by providing additional features and services. To manage your plugins, open the server dashboard and navigate to **Plugins**.

## My Plugins

The my plugins tab displays your installed plugins. Clicking the dot menu on a plugin will allow you to configure it (if applicable), or uninstall it. If a plugin does not require any configuration, there will not be a Settings button within it's command menu.

* **Channels** - Internet channels provide access to streaming audio or video. For  more information, see [Channels](Channels).
