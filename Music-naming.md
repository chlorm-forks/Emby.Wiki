The recommended folder structure for music is Artist\Album\Song

```
 \Music
    \Artist Name
       \Album Name
          1- Song.mp3
          2- Song.mp3
```

This is not a requirement and other structures will also work, but this is the most common method.

## Multi-Disc Albums

Albums can have disc sub-folders using any of the following folder names, where X represents the disc number:
 
- Disc X
- Disk X
- CD X
- Disc-X
- Disk-X
- CD-X
- DiscX
- DiskX
- CDX
- VolX
- Vol-X
- VolumeX
- Volume-X

Any naming convention for audio files is acceptable. Track numbers are retrieved using embedded ID3 tag information.

## Music Videos

To add music videos, setup a library with the type "Music Videos". The naming conventions for music videos are identical to [movies](Movie naming).

To identify the artists and albums of music videos, use the [metadata manager](Metadata manager). Simply edit a music video and enter the artist(s) and/or album. Once complete, the artist and album pages will display links to the music videos.
