The recommended folder structure for music is Artist\Album\Song

```
 \Music
    \Artist Name
       \Album Name
          1- Song.mp3
          2- Song.mp3
```

This is not a requirement and other structures will also work, but this is the most common method.

Any naming convention for audio files is acceptable. Track numbers are retrieved using embedded ID3 tag information. Below is a table of the supported image file names:

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

## Multi-Disc Albums

Albums can have disc sub-folders using any of the following folder names, where X represents the disc number:
 
- Disc X
- Disk X
- CD X
- Disc-X
- Disk-X
- CD-X
- DiscX
- DiskX
- CDX
- VolX
- Vol-X
- VolumeX
- Volume-X

For example:

```
 \Music
    \Artist Name
       \Album Name
         \Disc 1
            1- Song.mp3
            2- Song.mp3
         \Disc 2
            1- Song.mp3
            2- Song.mp3
```

## Music Images

Images are supported in both artist and album folders, as well as images embedded within audio files.



## Music Videos

To add music videos, setup a library with the type "Music Videos". The naming conventions for music videos are identical to [movies](Movie naming).

To identify the artists and albums of music videos, use the [metadata manager](Metadata manager). Simply edit a music video and enter the artist(s) and/or album. Once complete, the artist and album pages will display links to the music videos.
