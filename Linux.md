###Installation:
Emby-Server is packaged and supported across on as many platforms and architectures as possible. You can find installation instructions that are distribution specific either [here](./Installation) or on our [OBS project page](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Aemby&package=emby-server). Additionally, you can find our official docker images on the hub which support amrv7l and amd64.
