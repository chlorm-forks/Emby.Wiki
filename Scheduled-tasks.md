Scheduled tasks are system operations that need to run periodically in order to keep your server up to date and running smoothly. Many of them take too long to be run within the normal library scan, so that's why we make them available as configurable scheduled tasks.

Scheduled tasks are accessed from the server dashboard by navigating to **Advanced** -> **Scheduled Tasks**.
