The Live TV feature allows for streaming live television and managing your DVR within Emby Apps. Live TV is setup in two steps:

* Configure your tuner devices
* Add a TV Guide data source

## Live TV Status

The status of your tv tuners is also displayed.

There is also the ability to manually refresh Guide data. This is normally run automatically and it is generally not needed for manual use, but it is provided here as a convenience.

In addition, the reset button next to each tuner will allow you to reset the tuner as needed for troubleshooting.

## Settings

The **Settings** tab allows you to configure how many days of guide data to download and display. More guide data provides a richer experience but may increase loading times.
