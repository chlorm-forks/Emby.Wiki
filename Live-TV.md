The Live TV feature allows for streaming live television and managing your DVR within Emby Apps. Live TV is setup in two steps:

* Configure your tuner devices
* Add a TV Guide data source

## Configure Your TV Tuner

Out of the box, Emby Server currently supports the following TV Tuners:

* HDHomerun (Dlna feature required)

Support for additional tuners can be added by installing a [Live TV Plugin](Live-TV-Plugins).

## Live TV Status

The status of your tv tuners is also displayed in the server dashboard by navigating to **Live TV**.

There is also the ability to manually refresh Guide data. This is normally run automatically and it is generally not needed for manual use, but it is provided here as a convenience.

In addition, the reset button next to each tuner will allow you to reset the tuner as needed for troubleshooting.

## Settings

The **Settings** tab allows you to configure how many days of guide data to download and display. More guide data provides a richer experience but may increase loading times.
