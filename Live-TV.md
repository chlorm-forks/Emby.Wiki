The Live TV feature allows for streaming live television and recording management through the user of a service provider plugin.

## Install a Live TV Service Provider Plugin

Service providers are available in the plugin catalog.

To browse the catalog, open the server dashboard and navigate to **Plugins** -> **Catalog**.

For more information on plugins, as well as how to install and configure them, see [Plugins](Plugins).

## Service Provider Settings

To configure the settings for your service provider, simply click on it within [My Plugins](Plugins#my-plugins). 

## Global Live TV Settings

There are also settings that can be configured globally for Live TV. These are found in the server dashboard by navigating to **Live TV**.

The page will display the current active service provider, as well as it's health status. If it displays an error message it will need to be resolved before Live TV can be utilized.

There is also the ability to manually refresh Guide data. This is normally run automatically and it is generally not needed for manual use, but it is provided here as a convenience.
