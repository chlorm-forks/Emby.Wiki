The Live TV feature allows for streaming live television and managing your DVR within Emby Apps. Live TV is setup in two steps:

* Configure your tuner devices
* Add a TV Guide data source

## Live TV Status

There are also settings that can be configured globally for Live TV. These are found in the server dashboard by navigating to **Live TV**.

The page will display the status of each service provider. If it displays an error message it will need to be resolved before Live TV can be utilized.

There is also the ability to manually refresh Guide data. This is normally run automatically and it is generally not needed for manual use, but it is provided here as a convenience.

## Tuner Status

The status of your tv tuners is also displayed.

In addition, the reset button next to each tuner will allow you to reset the tuner as needed for troubleshooting.

## Settings

The **Settings** tab allows you to configure how many days of guide data to download and display. More guide data provides a richer experience but may increase loading times.
