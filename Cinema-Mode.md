Cinema mode brings the theater experience straight to your living room with the ability to play trailers and custom intros before the main feature.

Cinema mode is configured in the server dashboard by navigating to **Playback** -> **Cinema Mode**. By default it is disabled.

## Choosing when to enable Cinema Mode

The configuration page allows you to choose the types of videos that will trigger cinema mode. Currently, Movies and Episodes are offered. A video is determined to be a Movie or Episode based upon the content type chosen when setting up the library.

## Internet Trailers

A vast library of internet trailers are available for use with cinema mode. The categories available are movies coming soon to theaters, movies coming soon to Dvd, movies coming soon to Netflix, and movies similar to content in my library.

This feature has two requirements:

* An [active supporter membership](http://mediabrowser.tv/donate)
* Installation of the [Trailer plugin](Plugins), either before or after enabling cinema mode.

## Local Trailers

If your movie folders contain local trailers, enabling this option will allow these trailers to be used within cinema mode.

## Custom Intros

In addition you can specify your own custom videos to be used with cinema mode. Simply create a folder containing the videos, and enter the path in the custom intro field:
