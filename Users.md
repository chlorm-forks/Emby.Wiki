Most operations within Media Browser are based around users. Users can have their own personalized media libraries, user data, recommendations, security settings, and more.

Users are managed within the server dashboard by navigating to **Users**. The page will display as many as three kinds of users: Local Users, Guests and Pending Invitations.

## Local Users

Local users are displayed under the user heading. These are users that you've created in the server dashboard.

A local user will be displayed with a cloud if it is linked to [Media Browser Connect](Media Browser Connect).

Linking a user to Media Browser Connect will enable an easier sign in process that doesn't require the user to know your server's ip address. For more information, see [Media Browser Connect](Media Browser Connect).

## Guests

Guests are users that you've invited using [Media Browser Connect](Media Browser Connect). By default Guests have limited permissions but administrators can easily control this to give them access to various features as desired.

Guests that you've invited will display as pending until they accept the invitation.
