Most operations within Media Browser are based around users. Users can have their own personalized media libraries, user data, recommendations, security settings, and more.

Users are managed within the server dashboard by navigating to **Users**. The page will display as many as three kinds of users: Local Users, Guests and Pending Invitations.

## Local Users

Local users are displayed under the user heading. These are users that you've created in the server dashboard.

A local user will be displayed with a cloud if it is linked to Media Browser Connect.
