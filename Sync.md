## Mobile Sync

Mobile sync feature allows you to copy your content to mobile devices for offline viewing. Sync jobs are created using either the server's web interface or an Emby app on a mobile device. The server will then convert the media for the device as necessary. The apps will then sync the content by running a periodic background sync process.

The apps that currently support syncing are:

* **Windows 8.1**

The feature is coming soon to:

* **Android**
* **iOS**
* **Windows Phone**

## Cloud Sync

Cloud sync allows you to copy content to cloud storage accounts, for backup as well as archiving in multiple resolutions.

When content is archived in multiple resolutions, Emby apps will automatically choose the version that is most efficient for them. This will help relieve stress on your internet connection as well as your server's CPU. Apps will browse the content through your Emby Server as normal, but will stream from the cloud during playback.

Cloud Sync is currently available for:

* [Google Drive](Google Drive)

## Folder Sync

Folder sync allows you to copy content to folders and external hard drives, for backup as well as archiving in multiple resolutions. 

When content is archived in multiple resolutions, Emby apps will automatically choose the version that is most efficient for them. This will help relieve stress on your server's CPU.
