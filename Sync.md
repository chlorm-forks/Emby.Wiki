The sync feature allows you to copy your content to mobile devices for offline viewing. This is done by creating sync jobs using either the server's web interface or a Media Browser app on a mobile device. The server will then convert the media for the device as necessary. The apps will then sync the content by running a periodic background sync process.

The apps that currently support syncing are:

* Windows 8.1

The feature is coming soon to:

* Android
* iOS
* Windows Phone

## User Access

Access to the sync feature can be managed individually for each user.
