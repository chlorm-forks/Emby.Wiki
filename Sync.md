The sync feature allows you to copy content to external devices for backup purposes, archiving in multiple resolutions, and offline viewing.

## Mobile Sync

Mobile sync feature allows you to copy your content to mobile devices for offline viewing. Sync jobs are created using either the server's web interface or an Emby app on a mobile device. The server will then convert the media for the device as necessary. The apps will then sync the content by running a periodic background sync process.

The apps that currently support syncing are:

* **Windows 8.1**

The feature is coming soon to:

* **Android**
* **iOS**
* **Windows Phone**
