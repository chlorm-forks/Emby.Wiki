The hardware requirements for the server will depend on the number and type of devices you're planning to connect to the Server. If all the connected devices are computers such as PC/Mac/Linux, the Server requirements are less than mobile devices that need media transcoding.

Transcoding is the process where media is converted from one resolution or format to another (e.g. playing Full HD media on some smartphones requires transcoding). The process is CPU-intensive, so an older/slower PC might not be up to the task.

## Windows, Mac, Linux, or FreeBSD computer
### Minimum Requirements — no transcoding
* Intel Core 2 Duo processor 1.6 GHz or better
* At least 1GB RAM for Windows/Mac OS X
* At least 512MB RAM for Linux
* Windows: Vista or later
* OS X: Snow Leopard 10.6.3 or later
* Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS or SuSE Linux

### Recommended Configuration — transcoding HD Content:
* Intel Core 2 Duo processor 2.4 GHz or better
* If transcoding for multiple devices, a faster CPU may be required
* At least 2GB RAM
* Windows: Vista or later
* OS X: Snow Leopard 10.6.3 or later
* Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS or SuSE Linux

## Network Requirements
### Minimum requirements
* An ADSL/Cable/WiFi Internet connection for media metadata and software updates
* Uncongested, strong signal Wi-Fi network 802.11n OR
* Wired megabit network

### Recommended configuration
* An ADSL/Cable/WiFi Internet connection for media metadata and software updates
* Uncongested, strong signal 802.11n/ac wireless network for the mobile devices
* Wired gigabit network
