Media Browser has two distinct parts:

* Server — Store your media library in a central place
* Apps — Players that play back media from the Server

A fully-functioning Media Browser system needs both a Server and at least one App. The Server includes the Media Browser web app which is used to manage the Server and your media library. The web app also includes a media player so a minimal installation could be just the server, but most people will want to install apps on other devices around their home.

## Has someone invited you to their server?

If you have received an invitation to share an existing Media Browser server, then you can skip the server installation process and jump straight to app installation. Choose one of the many apps we have available:

## Prepare your media

Media Browser identifies your media according to folder structure, file name, and the type of library to which it is assigned. Once identified, Media Browser downloads information like posters, descriptions, and ratings that make media selection a rich experience. The requirements for organizing and naming files are quite flexible, but will require some basic structure.

The general recommendations are:

* Separate media into appropriate folders (e.g., Movies in a "Movies" folder, TV shows in a "TV Shows" folder, music in a "Music" folder, photos in a "Photos" folder, etc.)

* Movies should be named as "Name (Year).exe", for example "Brave (2012).mp4"

* TV shows should include season and episode numbers in the name, and be stored in separate folders per show. For example: "\TV\Homeland\Homeland s01e01.mp4"

* Music should be stored within artist and album folders, such as "\Music\Artist\Album\tracks"

## Install the Server
Once your media is named and organized, it's time to install the Server. The server is available on a number of platforms ranging from Windows to Linux, Mac, FreeBSD and Nas devices.

For  more information, see [installation](Installation).

## Install apps on your devices

Once your installation is up and running and you've completed the startup wizard, it's time to install apps on your devices.
