Media Browser has two distinct parts:

* Server — Store your media library in a central place
* Apps — Players that play back media from the Server

A fully-functioning Media Browser system needs both a Server and at least one App. The Server includes the Media Browser web app which is used to manage the Server and your media library. The web app also includes a media player so a minimal installation could be just the server, but most people will want to install apps on other devices around their home.

## Has someone invited you to their server?

If you have received an invitation to share an existing Media Browser server, then you can skip the server installation process and jump straight to app installation. Choose one of the many apps we have available:
