Media Browser has two distinct parts:

* Server — Store your media library in a central place
* Apps — Players that play back media from the Server

A fully-functioning Media Browser system needs both a Server and at least one App. The Server includes the Media Browser web app which is used to manage the Server and your media library. The web app also includes a media player so a minimal installation could be just the server, but most people will want to install apps on other devices around their home.
