By default, users have the ability to change their own passwords, so this function is handled in areas that don't require administrative access. If you would like to change the password for a user, navigate to the server dashboard -> **Users** -> **Click User** -> **Password**.

Click Configure Password. You will then be taken to the user-facing side of the web interface where you can change or reset the password.

**Note**: Guest passwords are managed by Media Browser Connect and can only be changed by the user themselves.

### Local Access

If a password is configured, you can choose to allow in-home network access without the use of a password.

**Note**: Enabling this option may introduce security risks. Incoming ip addresses can be spoofed, therefore there is no way for the server to determine with 100% accuracy that the request is coming from inside your home network.
